Turing made a game about an interpreter has to know if the machine can imitate the human and if the interpreter knows if it is a human or a machine. There are arguements that the AI can't imitatate
what a human can like the soul and essence of the human, it has limitations and humans don't, it can never exhibit creativity, it will only have new ideas when it is programmed to, and it wil only think when it 
undergo some experiences. Despite all that Turing still have solutions or answers for their objections which he said that the machines have potential to evolve further and further in the future. He also stated that
with the correct and adequate programming it will be closer to a human brain but in the physical matter it will be harder. Turing's work will still continue on evolving the AI into be closer to be a human mind
